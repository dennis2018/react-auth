In this blog post, we'll explore the seamless integration of JWT authentication with React and react-router. We'll also learn how to handle public routes, secure authenticated routes, and utilize the axios library to make API requests with the authentication token.

## Create a React Project
The following command will create a react project for us.

```
npm create vite@latest react-auth-demo
```

We will choose `React` as our framework and `JavaScript` as a variant.
To begin working on our project, we need to ensure that all dependencies are properly installed. We can achieve this by running

```
npm install
```

within our project directory. Once the installation process is complete, we can launch our React project using the command

```
npm run dev
```
